    <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
    <p>My audience consists of adults from ages 18-55. They are men and women who work in Temple, Fort Hood, or Austin. These people may not necessarily live in these cities, but because they work there, they need to be able to know what the weather is like so that they can prepare their clothing and transportation accordingly. This website will allow them to see current weather news as well so that they have an idea of how the weather changes and how it affects the residents. This audience needs a site that is effective and quick because they do not have time to waste.
    </p>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p><strong>-Muriel Jameson</strong> is a single 20-year old student at the University of Texas at Austin.
       She is studying communications and lives with her parents in Fort Hood. She has to
       commute three times a week, but she likes to drive. She is a sophomore who would like
       to move to Austin at least for her Senior year. She is comfortable using computers, 
       especially since she had to take a semester online because of the pandemic.  </p>

    <p><strong>-Michael Daniels</strong> is a married 30-year-old resident at Scott & White Hospital.
    He has a family of four and recently bought a house in Temple. He focuses on anesthesia 
    and knows that he will have to stay in Temple for at least three years. After that, who knows
    where his journey will take him! He feels comfortable using technology and has to send emails daily.</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>

        <li>Michael only visits sites with great reviews. Will this website provide that?
        <p>This weather site will allow people to leave a review of their experience so that the users can have an idea of how the website works and that the developer can fix any problems.</p></li>
        <li>Muriel wants to move to Austin on Saturday but it is only Wednesday. Can she see future predictions of the weather?
